## 🤔 Who am I?

I'm that guy who gets genuinely excited when a 500-line debugging session finally works at 3 AM! 🌙 

Currently a **21-year-old tech enthusiast** from Mumbai who believes that **code should solve real problems**, not just look pretty in repositories. I'm on a mission to build applications that people actually want to use (revolutionary concept, I know! 😄).

**My philosophy:** *"Why build something boring when you can build something that makes people go 'wow, that's actually useful!'?"*

## 🎯 What drives me?

- **🔥 Problem-solving addiction** - I genuinely enjoy the "aha!" moments when complex problems click
- **🚀 Building for impact** - Every project I create aims to solve a real-world problem
- **🤖 AI/ML fascination** - The intersection of human intelligence and machine learning blows my mind
- **💡 Innovation over imitation** - I'd rather fail at something original than succeed at copying
- **🌱 Continuous learning** - Tech evolves fast, and I'm here for the ride!

## 🛠️ My toolbox (and why I love each)

### Languages that speak to me:
- **Java** - My first love, solid and reliable like that friend who always has your back
- **Python** - Because life's too short for complicated syntax
- **JavaScript** - The chaotic neutral of programming languages, but man does it get things done
- **C++** - When you need that raw performance and don't mind getting your hands dirty

### Tech Stack I'm obsessed with:
```
🎨 Frontend: React.js (because who doesn't love virtual DOM magic?)
⚡ Backend: Node.js + Express.js (JavaScript everywhere = happiness)
🧠 AI/ML: TensorFlow, LangChain (turning data into intelligence)
🗄️ Databases: MongoDB (JSON everywhere!), MySQL (when you need that ACID reliability)
🔧 Tools: Git (time travel for code), Postman (API whisperer)
```

## 🎪 Projects I'm actually proud of

### 🎮 SkillXchange - *"Uber for knowledge sharing"*
Ever thought "I wish I could trade my coding skills for someone's guitar lessons"? Well, now you can! Built a platform where people exchange skills through virtual meetings and earn "skill coins". It's like a bartering economy, but for the digital age.

**Cool factor:** Video SDK integration + real-time chat + gamification = addictive learning experience

### 🤖 Hire360.ai - *"Making job interviews less scary"*
Tired of generic interview questions? This AI-powered platform analyzes your resume, the job description, and generates personalized interview questions. Oh, and it also analyzes your facial expressions and voice tone during practice interviews. Kinda creepy, but super helpful!

**Mind-blowing feature:** Multimodal assessment that combines text analysis, computer vision, and audio processing

### ⚽ TurfIt - *"Tinder for sports teams"*
Finding teammates for your weekend football match shouldn't be harder than finding a date! This app matches teams based on location, skill level, and sport preferences. Plus, it helps you find and book sports facilities.

**Personal touch:** Born from my own frustration of organizing cricket matches with friends

### 🏥 Medical RAG Chatbot - *"WebMD, but actually helpful"*
Built a medical chatbot that doesn't just give you generic responses but actually searches through medical literature and provides contextual, cited information. It's like having a medical librarian in your pocket.

**Nerd alert:** Uses vector databases for semantic search - basically, it understands what you're really asking, not just keyword matching

## 🎭 Random facts about me

- 🇫🇷 Learning French because "Bonjour" sounds cooler than "Hello"
- 🎨 Won a poster-making competition (who knew engineers could be artistic?)
- ☕ Coffee-to-code ratio: 1:3 (one cup per three hours of coding)
- 🌙 Night owl - My most productive hours are 10 PM to 2 AM
- 🎵 Code better with music - my Spotify knows my coding schedule

## 📊 GitHub Stats (because numbers are fun)

## 💬 Let's chat!

I love connecting with fellow developers, sharing ideas, and maybe collaborating on something cool. Whether you want to discuss the latest AI trends, need help with a project, or just want to argue about tabs vs spaces (team spaces, obviously), hit me up!
